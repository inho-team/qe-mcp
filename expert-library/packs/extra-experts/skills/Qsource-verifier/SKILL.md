# Source Verifier — Source Verification Methodology

Systematically verifies the credibility of sources and the authenticity of digital content.

## SIFT Methodology

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **S** — Stop | Stop | Do not share or cite before verifying |
| **I** — Investigate | Investigate the source | Who is behind the information? |
| **F** — Find | Find other coverage | What do other credible sources say? |
| **T** — Trace | Trace claims | Find the original source of the claim |

## Source Credibility Assessment

### Assessment Template

```markdown
## Source Assessment: [Source Name]

### Basic Identification
- [ ] Real name/organization confirmed
- [ ] Contact information verifiable
- [ ] Professional credentials verifiable
- [ ] Online presence is consistent across platforms

### Expertise Assessment
- [ ] Has relevant expertise for the claim
- [ ] Has track record in the field
- [ ] Recognized by peers
- [ ] No history of spreading misinformation

### Motivation Analysis
- [ ] Potential conflicts of interest identified
- [ ] Financial interest in the outcome?
- [ ] Political/ideological motivation?
- [ ] Related to personal grievances?

### Cross-Verification
- [ ] Claim independently verifiable?
- [ ] Confirmed by other credible sources?
- [ ] Documentary evidence exists?
- [ ] Contradicting sources exist?
```

### Credibility Ratings

| Rating | Criteria |
|--------|---------|
| **High** | Real name, relevant expertise, documentary evidence, no conflict of interest |
| **Medium** | Real name but expertise partially unclear, or indirect interest |
| **Low** | Anonymous, unverified expertise, potential conflict of interest |
| **Suspicious** | History of misinformation, clear conflict of interest, unverifiable |

## Digital Content Verification

### Image Verification

```markdown
## Image Verification Process

### Step 1: Reverse Image Search
- Google Images (images.google.com)
- TinEye (tineye.com)
- Yandex Images (yandex.com/images) — best for facial recognition
- Bing Visual Search

### Step 2: Metadata (EXIF) Check
- Original capture date/time
- Camera/device information
- GPS coordinates (if present)
- Software used for editing

### Step 3: Image Content Analysis
- Weather conditions (match reported date?)
- Shadows (match time of day?)
- Signs/text (correct language for the location?)
- Architecture (match claimed location?)

### Step 4: Find Original Source
- When did it first appear online?
- Original photographer/source
- Original posting context
- Has it been used in other contexts?
```

### Social Media Account Analysis

```markdown
## Account Verification Checklist

### Account History
- Creation date (older = more credible)
- Posting frequency and patterns
- Activity gaps (dormant then suddenly active?)

### Network
- Follower/following ratio
- Follower quality (real accounts vs. bots)
- Connections with verified accounts

### Red Flags
- Recently created account making bold claims
- Sudden changes in topic/tone
- Coordinated behavior with other accounts
- Stock photo profile picture
```

### Document Verification

```markdown
## Document Verification Steps

### Metadata Inspection
- Creation date and edit history
- Author information
- Software used
- Embedded fonts/images

### Visual Inspection
- Consistent formatting throughout
- Font consistency (no synthesized text)
- Text/image alignment
- Quality consistency across pages

### Content Verification
- Dates internally consistent
- Names spelled consistently throughout
- Reference numbers valid
- Contact information verifiable
- Letterhead matches known examples

### Source Tracing
- How was the document obtained?
- Chain of custody documented?
- Original vs. copy
```

## Verification Record Template

```markdown
## Verification Record

**Subject:** [claim/content description]
**Source:** [name/account/platform/URL]
**Verification Date:** [date]

### Verification Steps

#### Step 1: [Description]
- Actions taken:
- Tools/methods used:
- Result:

#### Step 2: [Description]
...

### Cross-Checked Sources
1. [Source 1] — [what it confirmed]
2. [Source 2] — [what it confirmed]

### Contradicting Information
1. [Source] — [contradiction]

### Verdict
- [ ] Verified (true)
- [ ] High confidence (likely true)
- [ ] Unverified (insufficient evidence)
- [ ] Low confidence (contradicting evidence exists)
- [ ] Confirmed false

### Basis for Verdict
[Evidence-based conclusion]
```

## Evidence Preservation

### Web Archiving

- **Wayback Machine** (web.archive.org/save/) — general web archive
- **Archive.today** (archive.ph) — snapshot preservation
- **Perma.cc** — permanent preservation for academic/legal use

### Screenshot Principles

1. Full-page capture
2. Include URL bar (show source URL)
3. Include timestamp
4. Save both PNG (lossless) and PDF
5. Record time and method of capture

## Execution Rules

### MUST DO
- Follow SIFT order (Stop → Investigate → Find coverage → Trace origin)
- Use WebSearch to investigate source background and credibility
- Actively search for contradicting evidence
- Document the verification process

### MUST NOT DO
- Do not declare "verified" from a single source
- Do not accept expertise based on self-claim alone
- Do not judge credibility intuitively without verification process
- Do not assess credibility solely by social media follower count
