description: Writes user stories (Mike Cohn format) with Gherkin acceptance criteria and INVEST validation. Use for 'write user stories', 'create a story', 'acceptance criteria', 'backlog items', 'user story', 'acceptance criteria'. Distinct from Qpm-prd (full PRD document) — this produces individual development-ready stories.
invocation_trigger: When product discovery, requirements, or roadmap planning is required.

## Scope Boundary
**Distinct from:** Qpm-prd (full document), Qgenerate-spec (task specs). This skill writes individual INVEST-format user stories with Gherkin acceptance criteria. It does not produce comprehensive PRD documents (see /Qpm-prd) or task specifications for internal QE processes (see /Qgenerate-spec). User stories are development units; PRDs are strategic documents.

## Purpose
Generate clear, concise user stories by combining Mike Cohn's user story format with Gherkin acceptance criteria. Converts user needs into outcome-focused development tasks and provides testable success criteria.

## Core Formats

### Use Case (Mike Cohn Format)
```
As a [user persona/role]
I want to [action to achieve outcome]
so that [desired outcome]
```

### Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin Format)
```
Scenario: [brief scenario description]
Given: [initial context or precondition]
and Given: [additional precondition]
When: [event that triggers the action]
Then: [expected result]
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Context
- Identify the user persona
- Understand the problem being solved
- Define the desired outcome
- Identify constraints

### Step 2: Write the Use Case
```markdown
### User Story [ID]:
- **Summary:** [concise, value-focused title]

#### Use Case:
- **As a** [user's name if available, otherwise persona]
- **I want to** [action the user takes to reach the outcome]
- **so that** [desired outcome]
```

**Quality check:**
- Is "As a" specific? (e.g., "trial user" vs "user")
- Is "I want to" a user action, not a feature?
- Does "So that" explain the motivation?

### Step 3: Write Acceptance Criteria
```markdown
#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** [scenario description]
- **Given:** [precondition]
- **and Given:** [additional precondition]
- **When:** [trigger event]
- **Then:** [expected result]
```

**Rules:**
- Only one When (multiple = split the story)
- Only one Then (multiple = split the story)
- Then must be measurable

### Step 4: Write the Summary
```markdown
- **Summary:** short, memorable, value-focused title
```
✅ "Enable Google login for trial users to reduce friction"
❌ "Add login button"

### Step 5: Validate and Refine
- Read aloud to the team
- Confirm QA can write test cases from it
- Split if too large

## Good Example
```markdown
### User Story 042:
- **Summary:** Enable Google login for trial users to reduce friction

#### Use Case:
- **As a** trial user visiting the app for the first time
- **I want to** log in with my Google account
- **so that** I can access the app without creating and remembering a new password

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- **Scenario:** First-time trial user logs in with Google OAuth
- **Given:** I am on the login page
- **and Given:** I have a Google account
- **When:** I click "Sign in with Google" and approve the app
- **Then:** I am logged into the app and redirected to the onboarding flow
```

## INVEST Validation Checklist

Before finalizing each story, validate against INVEST criteria:

| Criterion | Question | Fail Signal |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **I**ndependent | Can this story be delivered without other stories? | "Depends on US-03" |
| **N**egotiable | Is the implementation flexible? | Prescribes specific UI/tech |
| **V**aluable | Does it deliver user/business value? | Pure tech task |
| **E**stimable | Can the team estimate effort? | Too vague or too large |
| **S**mall | Fits in a single sprint? | Multi-sprint epic |
| **T**estable | Can QA write test cases from it? | Subjective criteria |

If any criterion fails → revise or split the story.

## 3 C's Framework

Each story has three dimensions (Ron Jeffries):

1. **Card** — Brief title and summary (the artifact)
2. **Conversation** — Discussion between PM, dev, and design about intent and edge cases
3. **Confirmation** — Testable acceptance criteria (Gherkin format above)

A story without Conversation context is just a ticket. Include:
- Design file links (Figma, Miro, etc.) when available
- Key conversation notes or decisions
- Edge cases discovered during discussion

```markdown
#### Design References:
- Figma: [link]
- Miro: [link]

#### Conversation Notes:
- [key decision or edge case from discussion]
```

## Anti-Patterns
- "As a developer, I want to..." → technical task, not a user story
- "As a user" (too generic) → use a specific persona
- "so that I can save" (repeating the action) → write the real motivation
- Multiple When/Then → split the story
- "Then the experience improves" (not measurable) → be specific
- No design references → link Figma/Miro when designs exist
- Skipping INVEST check → validate every story before grooming
