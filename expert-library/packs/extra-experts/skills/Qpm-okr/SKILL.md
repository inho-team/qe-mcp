description: Brainstorms and writes OKRs with SMART validation, initiative mapping, and roadmap connection. Use for 'OKR', 'objectives', 'key results', 'quarterly goals', 'goal setting', 'key results', 'quarterly goals'. Distinct from Qpm-roadmap (work sequencing) — this defines measurable goals and success criteria.
invocation_trigger: When product discovery, requirements, or roadmap planning is required.

## Scope Boundary
**Distinct from:** Qpm-roadmap (work sequence), Qpm-strategy (market analysis). This skill defines measurable objectives and key results (OKRs) that answer "where do we want to go?" and validates they are SMART. It does not sequence execution into quarters (see /Qpm-roadmap) or perform market/competitive analysis (see /Qpm-strategy). OKRs set *direction*; roadmaps execute it.

## Purpose
Guide OKR creation from objective brainstorming through key result validation to initiative mapping. Ensures OKRs are aspirational yet measurable, connected to roadmap execution, and free of common anti-patterns.

## OKR Writing Workflow

### Phase 1: Define Objectives (30 min)
An Objective answers: "Where do we want to go?"

**Rules:**
- Qualitative and inspirational — no numbers in the objective itself
- Time-bound (typically quarterly)
- Aligned to company/team mission
- 1-3 objectives per team per quarter

**Prompt questions:**
- What is the most important thing we must achieve this quarter?
- If we could only accomplish one thing, what would it be?
- What would make our users noticeably happier?

### Phase 2: Write Key Results (45 min)
A Key Result answers: "How do we know we got there?"

**Rules:**
- Quantitative and measurable — must have a number
- 3-5 Key Results per Objective
- Outcome-based, not activity-based
- Stretch but achievable (70% completion = success)
- Each KR is independently verifiable

**Formula:**
```
[Verb] [metric] from [current baseline] to [target] by [date]
```

### Phase 3: Map Initiatives (30 min)
An Initiative answers: "What will we do to move the needle?"

**Rules:**
- Each initiative links to one or more KRs
- Initiatives are projects, experiments, or tasks
- Not all initiatives need to succeed for KRs to be met
- Prioritize by expected impact on KR

## SMART Validation Checklist

Run this check for **every Key Result** before finalizing:

| Criterion | Question | Pass? |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **S**pecific | Is it clear what is being measured? No ambiguity? | |
| **M**easurable | Is there a number with a current baseline and target? | |
| **A**chievable | Is 70% completion realistic with available resources? | |
| **R**elevant | Does achieving this KR meaningfully advance the Objective? | |
| **T**ime-bound | Is there a clear deadline (quarter end or specific date)? | |

If any criterion fails, rewrite the KR before proceeding.

## OKR-Roadmap Connection Guide

OKRs set direction; roadmaps define execution. Connect them explicitly:

```
Objective (quarterly goal)
  └─ Key Result (measurable outcome)
       └─ Initiative (project/epic on roadmap)
            └─ Sprint Goals (2-week milestones)
                 └─ User Stories (development tasks)
```

**Connection rules:**
- Every roadmap epic should trace back to at least one KR
- If an epic has no KR connection, question its priority
- Sprint goals should reference which KR they advance
- During sprint review, report KR progress alongside velocity

**Alignment check questions:**
- Which KR does this epic move?
- If we ship this feature, which metric changes?
- Are we spending time on work that moves no KR?

## OKR Template

```markdown
## Objective: [qualitative goal]
**Owner:** [team or person]
**Quarter:** [Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4 YYYY]

### Key Results
- KR1: [metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]
- KR2: [metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]
- KR3: [metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]

### Initiatives
- [ ] Initiative A → drives KR1
- [ ] Initiative B → drives KR1, KR2
- [ ] Initiative C → drives KR3

### Mid-Quarter Check-in
| KR | Baseline | Current | Target | Confidence |
|----|----------|---------|--------|------------|
| KR1 | | | | |
| KR2 | | | | |
| KR3 | | | | |
```

## Good Example

```markdown
## Objective: Make onboarding so smooth that new users succeed on their own
**Owner:** Growth Team
**Quarter:** Q2 2025

### Key Results
- KR1: Increase Day-7 activation rate from 34% to 50% by Jun 30
- KR2: Reduce median time-to-first-value from 12 min to 5 min by Jun 30
- KR3: Decrease onboarding support tickets from 180/week to 80/week by Jun 30

### Initiatives
- [ ] Redesign onboarding wizard with progressive disclosure → drives KR1, KR2
- [ ] Add interactive product tour for top 3 use cases → drives KR1, KR2
- [ ] Build self-service knowledge base with video walkthroughs → drives KR3
- [ ] Implement onboarding health score email triggers → drives KR1
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Binary KRs** — "Launch feature X" is a task, not a measurable outcome. Rewrite as the metric the launch should move.
- **Too many KRs** — More than 5 KRs per Objective dilutes focus. If you have 7, merge or drop the weakest.
- **Activity-based KRs** — "Ship 10 features" measures output, not outcome. Ask: "What changes for the user?"
- **Sandbagging** — Setting targets you already hit. KRs should require stretch; 70% completion = good.
- **No baseline** — "Improve NPS" is meaningless without "from X to Y". Always measure the starting point first.
- **Orphan initiatives** — Work that connects to no KR. Either link it or deprioritize it.
- **Set and forget** — OKRs without mid-quarter check-ins drift. Schedule reviews at week 3 and week 7.

## Usage Examples
```
User: Help me write OKRs for next quarter
User: Help me brainstorm OKRs
User: Set quarterly goals and write key results
User: Review my OKRs and check if they're SMART
```
